<!--  Originally my idea for this project was to be a basic image host.  I had decided on utilizing web URLs as the source for the images.  I placed 36 different 
URLs in a csv file and had my "imageDataDAO" import and place the files in an array list.  
#1 personal lesson:  Using the URLs instead of internal files was a much bigger challenge for me.  As far as the logic is concerned, I don't believe it would
be any more difficult to for a more experienced developer to use URLs vs jpegs, but i had a difficult time with it. 
The images will display in their perspective categories... Holidays, Technology, Animals, and Food (not in that order).  The person viewing can click on 
each category and see the images displayed.  Additionally, they can upload their own url to be seen with the other images.
This was also a challenge.  For lack of time on my part, the code only allows for an image to be uploaded into the "Holiday" category.  
The user can also delete images.  I began with a deleteAll method to wipe out the entire arraylist.  That works very well. 
Sunday afternoon i began to work on code that would allow the user to delete one image at a time.  The logic uses the URL address itself
as the name for the file through href.  The user can click on any chosen image and it will be deleted.  However, the output after that would 
show ALL the images in the csv file instead of just the images in their perspective categories.  
It was already late Sunday evening and was ready to go home (I was still at skill distillery at 7pm sunday night)
SO... i decided to just keep the deleteAll method in place.  Its not ideal, but does complete the CRUD requirements.
Hopefully i'll be able to modify this application in the near future to improve on its potential.
NOTE***** When uploading a new photo.. it's automatically stored in "Holiday".  Ran out of time to give the user category selections. So.. if you upload 
an image, go to Holiday and you will see your image there.****  -->
